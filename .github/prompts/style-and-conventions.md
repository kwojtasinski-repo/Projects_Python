# Style and Conventions

Python:

- Follow PEP8 where reasonable
- Prefer explicit over implicit
- Type hints where they add clarity, not everywhere

Django:

- Fat models > fat views (but keep balance)
- No business logic in templates
- Views stay thin and readable

General:

- Readability > cleverness
- No magic constants without explanation
- Prefer standard library over third-party tools
